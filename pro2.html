            <h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Founders</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center; align-items: center;margin-top: 20px;padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 30px;">Luxe Living is co-founded by Saurabh Ailawadi, who bring varied experience in the fields of design, interiors, retail and brand management. We at Luxe Living believe that your home should be your own haven; where you dine, work, sleep, dream and live amidst surroundings that inspire you and reflect your unique personality and aesthetics. Your home should be the most comfortable place, for it is rightly said that the things we love tell an intricate tale of who we truly are.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: center;align-items: center;padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 30px;">Our passion for crafting furniture that soothingly blends with strong aesthetics, stems from the gap we saw in the Indian market, motivating us to offer options that breathe easy and elevate your space. Branching out from the fast paced, mass produced and machine made industry, we are grounded by our respect for slow living and sustainability. Being aware of the impact that our choices have on the environment, and the value of age-old knowledge passed down through generations, we hope to create products that find harmony in strong aesthetics, nature inspired designs and quality craftsmanship. Intertwining the stories of our master artisans, each of our creations reflects authenticity and adds character to your home.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: center;align-items: center;padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 30px;">Our designs aim to echo the beauty of nature while enriching your space with authenticity. Whereas, our commitment lies in crafting pieces that not only grace your living spaces but also tell a story of tradition and innovation. Intertwining the stories of our master artisans, each of our creations bears the mark of their dedication and artistry. So, as we continue our journey, we are driven by the desire to create furniture that marries style and substance by blending timeless traditions with the modern sensibilities that make up our lives now.</p>
